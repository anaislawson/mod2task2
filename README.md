When the joystick > **2000** it should play the next song designated to that page

When the joystick > **1000** it should play the previous song designated to that page

When the button is **pushed** → move to the next page

When potentiometer > **0** and < **1365** → display the first song in that selection

When potentiometer > **1365** and < **2730** → display the second song in that selection

When potentiometer > **2730**  → display the third song in that selection

1/8th Cast Acrylic was used for the laser cutting and assembly of the box

Hot Glue Gun was used for assembling the enclosure

**Don’t forget to cut holes for all of the components (joystick, button, potentiometer, ESP32 port)**

Female  to female wires were used for a majority of connections but soldering all the wires is also feasible

Communication via the laptop can be supported in multiple ways but I used Javascript (Python for testing)
